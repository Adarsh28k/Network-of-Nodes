# Data Structures and Algorithms Implementations

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms. The focus areas include:

- **Linked Lists**
- **Graph Traversal & Shortest Path Algorithms**
- **Searching & Sorting Techniques**
- **Bit Manipulation**

These implementations were developed as part of regular contests and assignments, with solutions to Codeforces problem statements included.

## Contents

- **Linked Lists**: Implementations of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists with various operations.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, and more.
- **Sorting & Searching**: Classic algorithms such as Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, etc.
- **Bit Manipulation**: Common bitwise operations and tricks.
- **Codeforces Solutions**: Problem statements from Codeforces contests, solved and uploaded as part of assignments.
